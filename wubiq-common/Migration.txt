Migration from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2+
============================
- We've downgraded 2.3.1 pdfbox/fontbox from 2.0.1 to 1.8.6, if you are coming from 2.2.x no changes are needed.
- If you are updating from 2.3.1 you must use either:
java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = (java.awt.print.Pageable)new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument();

or 

java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDPageable(org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument());

Migration from 2.2.x to 2.3.1 (These changes does not apply for 2.3.2+)
=============================
- We've upgraded from pdfbox/fontbox 1.8.6 to pdfbox/fontbox 2.0.1.
The following is no longer valid:
java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = (java.awt.print.Pageable)new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument();

You should instead instantiate a org.apache.pdfbox.printing.PDFPageable, 
please do not confuse with our net.sf.wubiq.print.pdf.PdfPageable).
This is an example on how to use a PDDocument as a Pageable.
java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = new org.apache.pdfbox.printing.PDFPageable(new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument());
