Migrate from 2.2.x to 2.3.x
============================
- We've upgraded from pdfbox/fontbox 1.8.6 to pdfbox/fontbox 2.0.1.
The following is no longer valid:
java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = (java.awt.print.Pageable)new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument();

You should instead instantiate a org.apache.pdfbox.printing.PDFPageable, 
please do not confuse with our net.sf.wubiq.print.pdf.PdfPageable).
This is an example on how to use a PDDocument as a Pageable.
java.awt.print.Pageable pageable = new org.apache.pdfbox.printing.PDFPageable(new org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument());

For other changes related to pdfbox/fontbox see https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/migration.html

- Mobile devices 'Porti-S 2 in', 'Porti-S 3 in' and 'Porti-S 4 in' were renamed to:
